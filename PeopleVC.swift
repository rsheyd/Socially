 people tab should show a small number in red for number of people using app within 10 miles; it will usually be zero when the app first launches, but that's okay; 
 
 maybe until there's at least 1 person hide tab - no I think it's unnerving for users when an expected tab/button disappears randomly
 instead just display "Sorry, no users of Socially are in your area. Check back later!"
 
 add search bar at the top so you can quickly connect in-app when exchanging contact info with a person
